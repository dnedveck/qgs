# Quantified Grad Student

This project involves the data and analysis of what I am tracking in grad school

In `./data` there is `phase1` which corresponds to the first round of time tracking that I did during Spring and Summer 2014

There is also `phase2`, which is the second round of data collection, corresponding to the semester of Fall 2014.

`phase3` corresponds to the semester of Spring 2015.

### Weekly Report

This is a report for every week that gives me an overview of how I spent my time. Definitely a work in progress

Ideas for what to include

- plot of productivity and efficiency per day
- overview of % productivity for this week (do I want to compare to previous weeks? Distribution?)
- percent breakdown of time in each category, thesis research, other, outreach
 - for this I still need to classify my projects into certain categories, (do this with a grep), pretty much need to just clump my thesis research projects together
- week timeline chart to see what I was working on when? ust the categories from thesis / other/ outreach? Should look like google calendar.


### To Do

- get `phase1` data to a simialr format as `phase2` and greater, allowing for analysis across phases.
- do an analysis of `phase1` and `phase2` data
