# Quantified Grad Student Data and Analysis

Here is the data and my first run at analyzing the time tracking data that I've been collecting for the past couple months.

Data analysis is in R, using knitr to generate analysis reports.

## Questions

I started out this project to answer two main questions:
- *How much time to I invest in Grad School?*
- *Where does this invested time go?*

later I've decided to look at:
- on a per day basis, how efficient am I? or, How much time do I waste doing non-prodcutive things
- it would also be nice to see how my time I invest in things changes on a say to day basis --- I'll figure out some kind of graphical way to do this.
