- I think that the admin category is kind of becoming pointless, I think that I could just have admin pool into general:misc
- I'm starting a general:writing section to capture time that I am writing to myself about things, such as debriefings, and capturing thoughts on a topic.... the only thing is that I will be losing information on what topics I am writing on, as in I might be doing some specific writing on a project .... I'll just have this writing section be only general writing, meta stuff, or reflections.
