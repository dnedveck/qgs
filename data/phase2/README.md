# Phase 2 Time Tracking Categories

Phase: 9/2/2014 - 1/11/15

Starting 9/2/2014 I'm using a new partitioning schema for my time. Specifically I want to look at how my time goes into
- How much time am I actually doing research?
- How much time does my TA work take?
- How much time am I doing other grad student stuff 

Each one of my research projects get's its own GleeoProject, so I can have tasks of misc, meetings, and other things partial to that project

After some thought I decied that reading articles should really be a task within a category, so I moved it into study. Becuase what is reading but a part of learning new things (to study something). This way my study category has more meaning that it captures the time I spend trying to learn things. Either current state of the research with reading journal articles, or going over stats and stuff on the internet. 

## meta
- campustime (parallel recording of how much time I am on campus)

## general
- email
- misc (stuff that doesn't fall into categories well, errands)
- planning (GTD, project planning, long term planning)
- admin (stuff that I need to do regarding requirements of the program)
- lab meeting (including topic groups like ComGen)
- writing (writing stuff to myself, reflections and debreifings. Does not include project specific writing)
- gathering reading (collecting articles to read, organizing my reading material)


## orals
time spent prepping for my orals
- reading (reading articles and books)
- study (reviewing notes I've taken)
- gathering reading (finding reading to do, assembling my reading list)

## study (learning material)
time spent reading about and learning things pertaining to my projects, reading about R, stats, stuff like that. Things that directly are involved in doing my project 
- articles (reading journal articles)
- stats (learning stats) 
- computing (learning advanced R, workflows, and other computing things)
- misc (catchall for the other things I'm reading about)

## thesis
Work towards the thesis requirements, not the acutal research
- prelim (time spent working on my prelim)
- prelimPres (time spent preparing my prelim seminar presentation)


## MtHap 
Medicago HapMap project work
- misc (quick side projects that don't really relate to my project, note organizing)
- meeting
- SapGWAS (saponin assocatiation study project)
- MtGSS (Medtr Geospatial Saponin Structure project)
- PopStruc (Medtr population structure project)

## RhizPop
Rhizobial population structure project
- misc (note/book keeping, recording stuff)
- meeting
- lab work
- driving 
- pop sampling

## LocFor
Project looking at local / foreign Lotco
- misc ( recording stuff, organizing things, tending plants)
- meeting
- lab work
- analysis

## TA
- class (time in class, as well as office hours)
- misc (prepping for the class, answering questions, meeting with Fumi)
- grading (grading the work - parsing out how much time I spend grading)

## service
Time I spend on planning committees, as well as outreach work
- marketSci ("Science in your Back Yard" outreach project)
- CBS_Med Orientation (Orientation meetings, work, and the eventual orientation)
- Bell Musuem (Science Lab Curriculum dev for the Bell Museum)

## hacking (computer-based side projects)
- time tracking
- Regus2014 (time spent playing with the Regus2014 data)
- quantified grad student (other tracking stuff)
- website (work on my website and Grad School For Hackers blog)


## funding (applying for funding)


## Seminar
- research seminar
- evolTWIN
- Friday seminar (time in the Friday PBS seminar, techincally this is a course, but I think it fits here as well)


## personal
- eating (only eating stuff, not including lunch break time)
- sleeping (naps)
- meditate (meditating as a means of destressing)
- lifting (time I'm in the gym working out)
- stroll (taking a break and going for a walk around campus)
