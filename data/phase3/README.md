# Phase 3 Time Tracking Data

Looks like each phase is ging to be from a different semester. Primarily this phase has the rearrangement of article reading time into each of the project categories where I am doing the reading for. To make it easier to section off the data analysis, I decided to split the data into a new phase. 

Splitting the reading data off into the projects reflects better how I am working on projects, as I'm often doing reading specific to a project, and it makes sense to capture it as such. I'm also keeping reading in the study section (or something equivalent) because I'm still going to be reading articles that don't directly correspond to a project I'm working on.
