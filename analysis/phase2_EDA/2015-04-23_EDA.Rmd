doing some EDA with the gleeodata 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
```

Loading in the data that I processed with `processGleeoExport.r` 

```{r}
load("2015-04-23_day.df.RData")
load("2015-04-23_gleeo.df.RData")
```

## QC

doing some quick QC to make sure my data is as expected

Checking to make sure that the efficiency looks right
```{r}
ggplot(day.df, aes( efficiency)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Efficiency per day")
```



## Plots

Looking at amount of time worked, per time at campus
... looks like I need to convert this data into a long format tbl_df
```{r}
daytime.df <- gather(data = day.df, type, time, 2:5 )
```


```{r}
daytime.df %>% filter(type == "campusTask" | type == "campusTime") %>%
  ggplot( aes(x = date, y = time, group = type)) + 
  geom_line()
```
