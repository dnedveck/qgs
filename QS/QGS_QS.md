Quantified Grad Student
========================================================

What I'm going to present
=======================
- Intro - why did I do this
- data collection - what kind of data did I gather
- analysis
- future directions - other questions?


Motivation
========================================================
- entering grad school - how much time do I need to invest
- anecdotal: it will take all of your time

But, who am I?
========================================
Grad student in Plant Biology
- Genomics (computational work), and local adaptation (field / greenhouse / lab work)
- How do I compare to other Grad students?
 - I'm probably not very representative... but then what is a "normal" grad student?


Questions
======================
- How much time do I invest in Grad School?
 - how much time do I spend on campus?
 - how much time am I working on grad school stuff? 
 - What percent of time that I am on campus am I actually getting work done?


Data Collection
===============================
Data collected
- Time doing work
- Time I'm on campus


Tools:
- Android App: Gleeo
- Google Spreadsheet on my phone

But how do I split my time up?
============================
How many categories?
- for a week, I tracked everything in a spreadsheet to get a sense of what I was doing
- then, from that I tried to come up with categories to partition the tasks in the most meaningful way, with the least amount going into a "misc" bin
- I'm still thinking about how best to partition my time, and am likely going to implement another scheme for the fall semester (starting September)
 
Tracked time breakdown
=================================
Tracked time as "Projects", with task subset
Projects:
- general; checking email, misc stuff, and admin work
- reading; reading articles and books
- seminar; sitting in department / research seminars
- meeting; meeting for projects, meeting with people about my thesis
- service; aka outreach
- hacking; doing fun stuff that benefits my grad school work (time tracking work, work on my website, tooling around in Linux)
- planning; capturing everything that I need to do GTD-style, and putting it in my calendar


Categories, cont. 
=================

- funding; applying for funding, either for academic support, or research funding
- thesis; work towards my thesis -- written prelims, oral exam, writing disseration, etc.
- MtHap; my RA work -- genomics, also it pays the bills
- rhizpop; main thesis work, this involved field, greenhouse, and lab work
- TA; (in the future), TA prep, sitting in lecutre, and then office hours / student help
 
 
Analysis
========================




Future work
============================
More questions, more data -- which are worth my time in pursuing?
- Rescuetime seems easy to implement and yield more data on what I am doing when I am working on a computer
- How much do I read?
 - time tracking data gets at this, but how many articles do I read?
 - I store my notes in markdown files, but this misses the ones that I read for my prelim (I read them, incorporated and cited them, without taking down notes)
 
- I want to get more "Deep Thought" time in (a la Cal Newport), what kind of metrics can I measure to view this
- what kind of metrics reflect success in Grad School?
- I've measured time in grad schol to get a sense of how much I am investing, but what can I measure to actually improve what I am doing?
 
 
Want more R?
